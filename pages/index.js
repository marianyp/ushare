						<h2>What is uShare?</h2>
						<p>
							uShare is a free tool that helps you share and view
							posts from various social media platforms, through a
							uShare link or by downloading a photo of the post.
							If you'd like a clean and easy way to share posts
							with friends and family that don't use the same
							social media platforms that you use, uShare is for
							you.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div className="content-b">
						<h2>Why?</h2>
						<p>
							Sharing posts from social media can be a little
							awkward. You don't want your friends/family to
							experience ads and popups when viewing posts on the
							web. uShare also provides a seamless way to download
							photos/videos from your submitted post seamlessly.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div className="content-c">
						<h2>What platforms does uShare support?</h2>
						<p>
							uShare currently supports sharing public posts from
							Facebook, public posts from Instagram, and tweets
							from Twitter. If you'd like to see your favorite
							social media/platform made compatible with uShare,
